        This function implements a general Genetic Algorithm. It uses fitness
        idependent mutation and crossover probabilities.

        fitness_function (function): The function that computes the fitness for
            each member. It takes an entire population, as a list of
            chromosomes, and output their fitness in the same order as a list
            of floats. If needed extra arguments may be added using args.
        args (tuple, optional): Contains the extra arguments for the
            fitness_function.
            Defaults to (), empty tuple.
        chromosome_length (int, optional): The length for the chromosome of the
            members.
            Defaults to 32.
        populationNumber (int, optional): The number of members in the evolving
            population.
            Defaults to 100.
        generationNumber (int, optional): The number of generations the
            algorithm will evolve.
            Defaults to 100.
        pc (float, optional): crossover probability, float number in range
            [0.0, 1.0).

        pm (float, optional): mutation probability, float number in range
            [0.0,1.0).
            Defaults to 0.001
        selection_probability (function, optional): The function that computes
            the selection probability. It takes the fitness distribution as a
            list and returns a list with values in range [0.0, 1.0) which add
            up tu 1 as a probability distribution. Defaults to
            difbased_selection.
        getEvolution (int, optional): Allows to get the evolution of the
            population. It's value defines the frequency for making records.
